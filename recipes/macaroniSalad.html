    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        This recipe is easily multiplied for a crowd. 
        Everyone in my family asks me to bring this to our functions. 
        I even make it for weddings. 
        Sometimes I use a mixture of different kinds of pasta, especially if I only have a little of this kind or that. 
        Depending on what type of macaroni used, more dressing may be required. The recipe calls for red onion, but sweet onion is great, too.
